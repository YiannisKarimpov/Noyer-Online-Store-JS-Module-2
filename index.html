        <h1>Introducing "The Allure of Stars Universe"</h1>
<!-- FIRST PART -->
        <section>


            <h2>LumiSquad - Light Heroes</h2>

            <p>LumiSquad is a team of light-aligned heroes who fight to protect balance, life, and hope in a fractured world. Their strength lies not only in power, but in trust, discipline, and restraint. Each member carries light differently — as healing, judgment, chaos, or protection — but together they represent the belief that light does not need to dominate to endure.   
            </p>
            <p>Theme: Hope, balance, unity <br>
            Style: Heroic, refined, resolute <br>
            Role: Defenders of the world</p>


        </section>
<!-- SECOND PART -->
        <section>
            <h2>GrimLight - Dark Heroes</h2>
            <p>Duskbound operates in the gray space between right and wrong. They confront threats that LumiSquad cannot, using forbidden methods, harsh decisions, and personal sacrifice. Where LumiSquad protects the light, Duskbound prevents the darkness from spreading — even if it costs them their reputation, morality, or lives.</p>
            <p>Theme: Sacrifice, secrecy, consequence <br>
            Style: Gritty, tactical, relentless <br>
            Role: Necessary shadows</p>

        </section>
<!-- THIRD PART -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Void Choir - Void Entities</h2>
            <p>The Void Choir is not a traditional enemy, but an existential force that seeks to erase meaning, identity, and emotion from reality. Its members are echoes of lost selves, bound together by a shared doctrine of unbeing. They do not conquer — they silence, rewrite, and unmake.
            </p>
            <p>Theme: Oblivion, corruption, loss of self <br>
            Style: Eldritch, ritualistic, unsettling <br>
            Role: Reality-level threat
            </p>
